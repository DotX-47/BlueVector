## 📌 What is BlueVector?

BlueVector combines multiple network utilities into a single command-line tool.  
It is designed to help understand:
- How networks respond to probes
- How services expose ports and banners
- How systems can be inspected from a defensive security perspective

BlueVector is suitable for:
- Internal company testing
- Research and learning
- Authorized security assessments

> ⚠️ Use only on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.
